A case study on scheduling MRI facilities

This case study aims to evaluate the efficiency of MRI scheduling policies at a hospital with scarce MRI resources. Two patient types with distinct scan durations and arrival patterns currently use separate MRI facilities, but management is considering combining these facilities to optimize utilization and reduce waiting times. To aid this decision, the study will analyze historical data, perform Monte Carlo simulations, and estimate key metrics such as scan durations and arrival rates using bootstrap methods to provide reliable estimates and assess the potential impact of a merged scheduling policy.
