# Case study on scheduling MRI facilities 

This case study aims to evaluate the efficiency of MRI scheduling policies at a hospital with scarce MRI resources. 
Two patient types with distinct scan durations and arrival patterns currently use separate MRI facilities, but management is considering combining these facilities to optimize utilization and reduce waiting times. 

## Part 1 - Statistical Analysis of MRI scan data 

To aid this decision, the study will analyze historical data and estimate key metrics including scan durations and arrival rates using bootstrap methods to provide reliable estimates and assess the potential impact of a merged scheduling policy. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the model specifications. 

## Part 2 - Optimizing Scheduling Policies 

A discrete event simulation is uesd to model scheduling under current and proposed systems. The study evaluates performance indicators including overtime, patient waiting time, system utilization and total number of patients served, considers uncertainty from statistical estimates, and offers advice on optimal time slot lengths to minimize overtime while meeting patient needs.
